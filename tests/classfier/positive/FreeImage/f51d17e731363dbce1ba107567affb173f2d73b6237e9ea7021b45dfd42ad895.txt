of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a

Intellectual Property Matters
Czr}dSeaMq
Third Party Claims.
If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in
particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you
must include a text file with the source code distribution titled
"LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain
such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in
Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make
available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
FgQCy*DxF?g-a8SD
Contributor APIs.
If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control
patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also
include this information in the LEGAL file.
(N
Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this
License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe
recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more
Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code
file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section
3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating
that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of
this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You
descr ibe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute
the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may
contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with
the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not
attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
