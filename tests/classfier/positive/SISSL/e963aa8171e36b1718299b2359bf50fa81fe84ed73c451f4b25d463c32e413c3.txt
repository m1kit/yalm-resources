                 Version. In the event that the Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to
                 publish either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from implementation of
                 Your Modifications and a reference implementation of Your Modifications or (ii) Your

                 then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
                 would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may

                 indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify

                 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is

                 notice in an Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You
