PREAMBLE
The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and
redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an "open source"
distribution model.
The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that
this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations.
As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by
the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the
holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
In this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks associated with loading,
using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free
Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is
reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are
therefore encouraged to load and test the Software's suitability as regards their requirements in
conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to
use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and
published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.
This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to
submit the operation thereof to its provisions.
