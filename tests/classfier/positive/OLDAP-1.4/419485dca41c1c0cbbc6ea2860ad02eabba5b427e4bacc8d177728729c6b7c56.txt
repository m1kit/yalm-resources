in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
